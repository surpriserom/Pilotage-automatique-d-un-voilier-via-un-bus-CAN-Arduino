HOW TO START ARDULINK'S APPLICATIONS

Ardulink has several applications you can start. You can double click on the right jar file or run they with
you system command line. Of course some applications need for parameters, so you have to start they from the
command line.

From your linux/windows/apple shell you can run these commands (from Ardulink's lib folder):

java -jar ardulink-console-0.6.1.jar
java -jar ardulink-networkproxyserver-0.6.1.jar
java -jar ardulink-mail-0.6.1.jar
java -jar ardulink-mqtt-0.6.1.jar


The Network Proxy Server accepts a mandatory argument. Please run it without arguments to read the usage.

The MQTT bridge accepts arguments. Please run it with -h option to read the usage.
