# When a FTDI device is connected to system linux kernel with udev tries to load appropriate VCP driver
# for connected device. It is possible to just unbind default driver for a particular
# device using udev rules (see tools-and-utilities/99-scm-extra-udev.rules for unbinding with the help of script).

id="aa"

# extract the device ID
in=$1
IFS='/' list=($in)
for item in "${list[@]}"; 
do 
	id=$item;
done

# unbind the driver from CDC interface
echo $id > "/sys$1/driver/unbind"
